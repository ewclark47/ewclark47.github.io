                    <p>I studied Mathematics and Spanish in my undergraduate program at the United States Military Academy. 
                        Upon graduation, I commissioned as an Air Defense Artillery Officer in the United States Army. 
                        Following positions as a Maintenance Technician and Maintenance Manager, Platoon Leader, Executive Officer and Battery Commander I completed my Masterâ€™s Degree at 
                        Carnegie Mellon University in the MISM-BIDA program with follow-on assignment at the Army Future's Command Artificial Intelligence Integration Center. </p>

                    <p>I am a husband and father. In my free time I enjoy finding analytical projects to work on that look to explain or answer common questions in today's society. 
                        I also enjoy reading, traveling and studying foreign languages.</p>
